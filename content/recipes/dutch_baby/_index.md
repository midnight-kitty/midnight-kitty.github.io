# Dutch baby

🕑 **Total time:** 45 mins 

⏲️ **Active time:** ~15 mins 

# Ingredients

- 1 cup of all purpose flour
- 1 medium egg (room temperature)
- 450 ml of milk (room temperature)
- 5g of butter
- pinch of salt

# Equipment

- Cast iron pan (medium or large)
- Blender

---

# Instructions

1. In a blender, combine the flour, egg, milk, and salt. Blend until smooth and lump-free. Let the batter rest for at least 10 minutes—ideally 30 minutes—for the best texture.

2. While the batter rests, preheat the oven to 400°F. Place the cast iron pan inside and allow it to heat thoroughly.

3. Carefully remove the hot pan from the oven and add the butter, swirling it around to coat the bottom and sides evenly.

4. Pour the batter into the pan, ensuring it spreads up the sides. Return the pan to the oven and bake for 10–12 minutes, or until the Dutch baby is beautifully puffed and golden brown.

5. Serve immediately and enjoy!


# Notes:

- This recipe makes two large dutch babies.
- Do not open the oen during the first 10 minutes of baking! 
- For a sweet option, top with powdered sugar, fresh fruit, or a drizzle of maple syrup for extra flavor.
- For a savory option, serve with bacon, eggs, cheese or sour cream.
