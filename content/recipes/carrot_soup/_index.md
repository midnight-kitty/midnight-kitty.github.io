## Instructions  

1. **Prepare Ingredients:** Peel and chop two carrots into thin circular slices. Slice the rest of the carrots into long, thin strips for later (a vegetable peeler will work for this as well).

1. **Saut√© Aromatics:** Heat 1 tablespoon of olive oil in a large pot over medium heat. Add the diced onion, the full garlic cloves, and ground ginger. Saut√© until fragrant, about 2-3 minutes. Add optional spices in this step.

1. **Cook Carrots:** Add the sliced carrot rounds to the pot. Stir to coat them in the aromatic mixture. Pour in the vegetable broth and bring to a boil.  

1. **Add Carrot Strips:** Once the broth is boiling, add the remaining carrot strips to the pot.  

1. **Incorporate Beans:** Stir in the rinsed white kidney beans and bring back to a boil.  

1. **Simmer and Stir:** Reduce heat to medium and stir frequently until the soup returns to a boil. Lower the heat and let the soup simmer for 20 minutes, allowing the flavors to meld together.

1. **Blend**: Transfer 3 ladles of the soup mixture into a blender or food processor. Blend until smooth. Stir the blended mixture back into the pot and let it simmer for another 5 minutes to fully incorporate the flavors.

1. **Serve:** Ladle the soup into bowls and garnish with chili flakes, fresh cilantro, and a grind of black pepper.  

Enjoy this warm and nourishing carrot soup as a satisfying lunch or dinner. Perfect for cozy winter evenings!

# Notes:

- The recipe goes better with white kidney beans but you can use any type of beans.
- The carrots will cook faster when sliced in thin strips. Diced or shredded carrot may take longer to cook and achieve the right consistency.
- Adding cumin or turmeric is optional and recommended for stronger flavours. Add the desired spices in step 2 for max flavour.
- If the soup feels too thick, add a little water or extra broth to achieve your desired consistency.
