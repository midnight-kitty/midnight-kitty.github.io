# Biscuits

üïë **Total time:** 30 mins 

‚è≤Ô∏è **Active time:** ~18 mins 

> **Chill your butter in the freezer for 10-20 minutes before starting the recipe!**
Cold butter is key to achieving light, flaky, and buttery biscuits.


## Ingredients

- 200g all-purpose flour
- 1 Tablespoon baking powder
- 1 teaspoon salt
- 85g unsalted butter **as cold as possible**. European butter is _ideal_, but not required.
- 170mL of cold milk.

## Instructions

1. **Combine wet ingredients**. Combine flour, baking powder, and salt in a large bowl and mix well. Set aside.
1. **Shred butter into medium pieces**. Remove your butter from the refrigerator and shred the butter into medium-sized pieces using a box grater. Add them to the flour mixture and stir until it resemble coarse crumbs.
1. **Add milk to soften the mix**. Add milk, use a wooden spoon or spatula to stir until combined. ‚ö†Ô∏è Don't over-work the dough!
1. **Transfer the dough**. Transfer your biscuit dough to a well-floured surface and gently work it together with your hands. If the dough feels too sticky, add a bit more flour until it‚Äôs easier to handle.
1. **Work the dough**. Once the dough comes together, fold it in half and lightly press the layers together with your hands. Rotate the dough 90 degrees and fold it again. Repeat this folding process 5-6 times. ‚ö†Ô∏è Don't over-work the dough!
1. **Flatten the dough**. Use your hands to flatten the dough to about 1-1.5cm thick.  ‚ö†Ô∏è Do not use a rolling pin! Lightly flour a round biscuit cutter, and make clean cuts by pressing straight down into the dough. Drop each biscuit onto your prepared baking sheet.
1. **Repeat until you've used all the dough!** ‚ú®
1. **Baking time**. Bake on 425F (or 400F in convection oven) for 12 minutes or until tops are beginning to just turn lightly golden brown.
1. [Optional] Brush with melted salted butter immediately after removing from oven.

### Notes

- The most effective method I've found for incorporating the butter is to shred it directly into the bowl while it's on the scale, ensuring you get the precise 85g. Adding too much butter can result in a messy, overflowed tray and burnt butter in the oven!
- I usually start pre-heating the oven after shredding the butter, it also helps saving some energy $$$.
- I have used almond milk as a substitute and it works well. Get it from the fridge right at the moment you need it. The colder the better!
- A key step is to get a dough that is not too wet or too dry. That may be tricky but you will finetune with practice!
