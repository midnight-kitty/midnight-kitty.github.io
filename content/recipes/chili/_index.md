**Ingredients:**

- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- 4 teaspoons chili powder
- 1 teaspoon dried oregano
- 1 teaspoon hot pepper flakes (optional, for extra heat)
- 2 (28-ounce) cans diced tomatoes
- 4 (19-ounce) cans beans, drained and rinsed (mixed beans, red romano, or black beans are recommended)
- 1 teaspoon salt
- 2 medium carrots, thinly sliced (optional)

**Instructions:**


1. Heat a large pot over medium heat and add a drizzle of olive oil. Fry the onions and garlic until the onions are translucent.
2. Heat a large pot over medium heat and add a drizzle of olive oil. Fry the onions and garlic until the onions are translucent.
3. Stir in the chili powder, oregano, and hot pepper flakes (if using). Cook for 1 minute, stirring constantly, to toast and release the flavours of the spices.
4. Add spinach (if using) and stir until wilted (fresh) or evenly distributed (frozen).
5. Pour in the diced tomatoes and stir. Cover the pot with a lid, and bring the mixture to a gentle simmer with the lid on.
6. Add the beans, and simmer for one hour with the lid off until the beans are tender and heated through. Optionally, leaving the chili simmering for 2-3 hours total will improve the flavour even more.
7. Once the beans are soft, season with salt to taste.
8. Stir in frozen or fresh corn. Cook until fully heated through and tender.


**Ground meat topping:**


- 1 lb ground meat (beef, turkey, or plant-based alternative)
- 1 tablespoon garlic bread seasoning
	- (Alternative: Combine a pinch of salt, 1/2 teaspoon garlic powder, 1/4 teaspoon each of oregano, basil, marjoram, parsley, and a sprinkle of parmesan cheese.)


1. Heat a medium-sized saucepan over medium heat.
2. Add the ground meat and break it up into small pieces using a spatula or spoon.
3. Cook the meat, stirring occasionally, until it is nearly cooked through (no longer pink but still juicy).
4. Stir in the garlic bread seasoning (or the alternative spice mix) and cook for an additional 2–3 minutes, ensuring the meat is fully cooked and well-seasoned.
5. Remove from heat and serve as a topping for your chili or other dishes.
